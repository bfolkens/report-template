# Report Template

Inspired by the Tufte book design and https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/

## Usage

The `report.tex` file contains the high-level organization, fonts, etc.  Each section has been organized into a `sections/` folder, with additional pdf reports included from `pdf/` and any images in `images/`.  This was originally used for an investor report, where Finance would deliver PDFs that would be included into the report directly.  This could've been alternatively done with some of the Tufte table-styling, but it was beyond the scope of the project.
